## Data access procedure

For access to either the study cbioportal page or EGA dataset, you need to download all the documents on this github and
send them back to us.

### Access to cbioportal

1) Send a request to the people aforementioned with all the documents signed.
2) Wait for a confirmation (this might takes a few weeks)
3) You can now have access to the controlled-access cbioportal via the link below
   <https://mappyacts-portal.gustaveroussy.fr:8081/study/summary?id=brca_daisy_2023>

### Access to the EGA dataset

Data access decisions can be passed to the EGA in two ways:
1) By emailing helpdesk@ega-archive.org with the email address of each applicant and confirmation of the dataset/s to
   provide access. EGA will then create an EGA account with the relevant access permissions.
2) By using the EGA DAC Admin tools (available to DAC's dealing with more than 5 data access applications/month).
   Further information on the DAC admin tools and how to access them can be found here:
   <https://ega-archive.org/submission/dac/tools>

In addition, do not forget to send all the documents needed.
